1)Hi Guys,
I have developed a model to predict the risk of suicides in US using various algorithms like Neural Network MLP, Random Forest, XGBoost.
Please look into it and put forward your reviews.


2)I have used VAR(Vector Autoregression ) and VARMA(Vector Autoregression Moving Average) to investigate causality between Money Stock and spending and found that for the time period under consideration, used in this model, there seems to be little inter-dependence.
